# Clicks
[Ticket](https://stylink.openproject.com/projects/data-science/work_packages/6701/activity/)

*"Since only 70 per cent of the referrer rate is known, an projection for the probability of platform use at link level should be given in the users profile/link overview. The aim is to show what proportion of platform utilisation is based on actual data and what proportion is based on projections."*

## Clicks without a `referer_host` usually happen due to:
- Direct Traffic (e.g., users typing the URL or clicking from emails/apps).
- Privacy Restrictions (e.g., HTTPS to HTTP transitions).
- Blocked by Browser Settings (some browsers strip referral data).
- Mobile Apps & Messengers (e.g., Instagram, WhatsApp donâ€™t always pass referrer info).
